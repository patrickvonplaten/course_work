\section{Motivation} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

Concentrate only on complete end-to-end autoencoder network. Not enough research on 
communication system using one sided neural networks.

Introduce reader to the topic. 
Explain motivation: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item so far every part of communication layer has to be optimized by itself
	\item very hard to find mathematical optimization for complete end - to -end system
	\item use autoencoder for end-to-end usage
\end{itemize}

\section{Conventional communication systems} 
\label{sec:communication_systems}

Describe here how conventional communication systems look 
like. 

\subsection{Structure of system}


\subsubsection{Transmitter}

Role of transmitter 


\subsubsection{Channel}

What is the actual channel 

\subsubsection{Receiver}

Role of receiver 
(put receiver and transmitter together)

% section physical_layer

\subsection{Advantages of current system}

In what ways are current communication systems already very 
efficient? 

\section{Applying deep learning to communication systems}

Explain the motivation of using deep learning methods to model 
end-to-end communication systems.
In which cases could deep learning be applicable for communication systems

\begin{itemize}
	\item possible efficiency improvements (or not)
	\item great adaptive properties to model communication systems in 
		unusual conditions (non-gaussian noise,...)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deep neural network basics}

Explain basics of DNN: MLP, every function can be modeled by DNN, 
activation functions, backpropagation,...

\subsection{Convolutional Layers in NN}
Explain how Conv. layers work and it's relation to signal analysis/
processing (applying conv layer to time signal is similar to applying 
fourier transform to it)
Why are they useful in this case?

\subsection{Autoencoder}

Explain motivation and why it works in case of communication systems.
Describe auto-encoder network in detail and show it's obvious relation to 
the physical layer in communication systems.

\subsection{Synchronization of information transfer}

How can neural networks overcome the problem of synchronization? 
What methods are used? (Start sending bit stream?)

\subsection{Training of autoencoder systems}

How is training be done?

\section{State-of-the-art deep learning methods for communication systems}

Give examples of system and their architecture

\subsection{Example system}

\subsection{Comparison deep learing methods and conventional methods}

Compare current ``state-of-the-art'' to system using deep learning.

\subsubsection{Performance measurement}

Define and introduce Signal-to-noise ration

\subsubsection{Results using deep learning methods}

State attained results. 

\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusion}

Conclude by trying to answer the question, whether it is useful 
to apply deep learning methods for communication systems (or under which 
circumstances it might be useful)
