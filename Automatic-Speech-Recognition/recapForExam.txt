- WER is very important to measure quality of ASR model

- What is the pipeline to compute preprossed acoustic vector (MFCC, mel, ...)
- Know measures and there properties.
- Time Alignment: In the beginning without any statistical measure. Align speech 
in non-linear ways. DP is used to solve Time Alignment. Different Topologies can 
be used to compute time alignment. 
- Understand DP - very important! 
- Isolated Speech recognition. One word given.
- Understand the concept that each observation is generated by a state. 
- Understanding the training doing time alignment and parameter optimization alternatively.

- Hidden Markov Model introduction -> very important! Markov properties are used: probability of state only depends on previous state! 
- Hidden Markov Model leads to Transition Probabilty * Emission Probability
- Gaussian Mixture Model - Why are they used? Mixtures Densities are explored for succesful speech recognition.
- Bayes Decision Rule - rule that is used during search to find optimal words

Training:
- Training: Viterbi Training - assuming that each observation belongs to the state. Again alternative training: parameter opti -> alignment -> parameter opti. Need to start with either initial parameters or fixed time alignment.
- Transition probabilites are also reestimated with the emission probabilites. 
- EM Algorithm - very important! Understand derivations of EM derivatives 

Connected Speech Recognition: 
- Word boundaries are introduced -> understand derivation of optimization criterion.
- Derivation of DP -> very important! 
- Too many parameters in model using whole word states -> use phonemes instead of words to have less subunits that need to be trained
- Introduction to CART (Phonetic Decision Trees)
- Perplexity important as well! optimise perplextiy to maximise model! What exactly is perplexity? 
- Use discounting to have none zero probability for unseen training data (smoothing). This makes it possible to recognize events unseen in training data. 
- Beam Search -> to reduce search space. Check slide 351 for beam search in action.
