100 points - 13 tasks

1) Explain and define:
- Speech recognition
- Speech understanding
+2 others 

2) Define 
- Word Error Rate and Levenshtein distance
- Edit distance + operations of edit distance

3) Minimal Distance
- Derive Recursion of minimal distance between sequence of vectors formula
- Properties of distance measure (symmetry, triangle, d(x,y) = 0) with application

4) 5 steps for MFCC 

5) Define Q(t,s,w) in own words: what does it stand for?
  
6) p(x|s) assuming single gaussian distribution - taking log() - comparison to distance measure

7) Language model trigram - maximum likelihood to derive optimal p(w|v,u) -> N(w,v,u)/N(w,v)

8) 
- Neural Network: How to get p(x|s) from p(s|x) (which is output of Hybrid model in NN)
- Why is output layer of Neural Network of language model so big? What can you do against it?

9)
- Difference linear search and tree search?
- Why is tree search with beam search better? 

10) 
- Fourier transformation of s(t) = exp(-|t|)

11) 
- Fourier transformation of function that is more complex using result of 11) and convolution theorem and 
some other properties of Fourier transformation

12) 
- What to pay attention for when choosing a window function for DFT having a given amount of samples of signal

13)
- Derive cepstral coefficents - how does that help to separate s[n] from h[n]

That's all I remember - the tasks might not be in the right order.
